This was my capstone project for my Code First Girls software engineering bootcamp. We developed a flask web app which serves as a feminist film search engine.

Users can filter search results via multiple categories depending on their preferences. 

The backend code base makes use of bechdel test APIs, NLTK libraries and database integration.
